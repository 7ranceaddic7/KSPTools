All the other information is taken from the wiki )\r\n\r\n![Mission Calculator](https://i.imgur.com/LhteoYF.png)\r\n\r\nThe second tool is Δv Calculator.\r\n\r\nIt can calculate the total Δv and the Δv for every single stage of your rocket. \r\n\r\nAlso it can provide to you the thrust per weight ratio of your rocket for every\r\nplanet-moon  among the Stock Game and the 2 popular Mods with planets (RSS, Outer Planet).\r\n\r\n![DV Calculator](https://i.imgur.com/Ixa7mPJ.png) \r\n\r\nThe third tool is Biome Maps.\r\n\r\nYou can choose between the planets-moons you like and it will provide\r\nto you the Biome Map and many details about the selected planet-moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Biome Maps](https://i.imgur.com/N0YWc3X.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifth tool is Δv Maps from the Community. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* JellyCubes (Original concept)\r\n* WAC (Original design)\r\n* CuriousMetaphor (Original out-of-atmosphere numbers)\r\n* Kowgan (Design, original in-atmosphere numbers)\r\n* Swashlebucky (Design)\r\n* AlexMoon (Time of flight)\r\n\r\n\r\n![DV Maps](https://i.imgur.com/fdp9Ng6.png) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last tool is the Terminology. \r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n* [Wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page)\r\n* Kosmo-not for his amazing [Interplanetary How-To guide.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7thj0Y_jJNRa1hKT2RZbHdlYUU/view)\r\n* [Rockets & Space Technology](http://www.braeunig.us/space/).\r\n\r\n\r\n![Terminology](https://i.imgur.com/veg7zH3.png)\r\n\r\nLatest Changelog: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nDownload the application, extract it to any folder you like and run it .\r\n\r\nImportant : it is needed .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.\r\n\r\nSource Code: https://github.com/Obrelix/KSPTools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to thank the Community for all the high value information they are giving for free.\r\n\r\nWithout that, I could not have managed to build this application. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [License:](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)\r\n![License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)\r\n",
