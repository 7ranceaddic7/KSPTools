This will lead to the vessel being slowed by atmospheric drag. Can lead to atmospheric entry, but also is used to reduce the necessary burn time for significant orbit alterations."/><LineBreak/><LineBreak/><Run Foreground="#FF0017FF" FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="14" Text="2) Lithobraking"/><LineBreak/><Run FontSize="14" Text="    An attempted aerobrake using the ground instead of air. Usage of this term implies jokingly that the resulting crash-landing was not in the original plan. An adaptation of the term aerobraking where aero was replaced by the Greek word lithos, meaning rock or stone."/><LineBreak/><LineBreak/><Run Foreground="#FF0017FF" FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="14" Text="3) Atmospheric entry"/><LineBreak/><Run FontSize="14" Text="    Entering atmosphere and using drag to decelerate a vessel to a groundwards trajectory. This causes intense heat stress on the object as the vessel requires sufficient speed to not &quot;bounce&quot; back from the atmosphere into space, and care must be taken not to overheat. This is usually called re-entry/reentry but in theory only correct in Kerbin's atmosphere; atmospheric entry being the more general term."/><LineBreak/><LineBreak/><Run Foreground="#FF0017FF" FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="14" Text="4) Burn"/><LineBreak/><Run FontSize="14" Text="    firing of the engines, usually to alter trajectory in some way."/><LineBreak/><LineBreak/><Run Foreground="#FF0017FF" FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="14" Text="5) Circularizing"/><LineBreak/><Run FontSize="14" Text="    Reducing an orbit's eccentricity to 0 or close to it.

In terms of vector addition, the vehicle has some relative velocity to the large body during the encounter, calculated by subtracting the large body's velocity from the vehicle's initial velocity. The vehicle travels in a hyperbolic path relative to the large body, and the inital and final velocities have equal magnitude but different directions. Then you add the large body's velocity again to get the final velocity in the beginning reference frame. The vehicle's speed increases when its velocity is deflected toward the large body's direction of motion. Larger deflection requires lower periapsis (without crashing) or greater large body mass."/><LineBreak/><LineBreak/><Run Foreground="#FF0017FF" FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="14" Text="7) Maneuver node"/><LineBreak/><Run FontSize="14" Text="    A planned maneuver in the map view, so as to predict the effect of a burn in advance of performing it."/><LineBreak/><LineBreak/><Run Foreground="#FF0017FF" FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="14" Text="8) Radial-in burn"/><LineBreak/><Run FontSize="14" Text="    A burn performed directly towards the center of a celestial body. It rotates the orbit counter-clockwise until the periapsis passes the center of mass of a celestial body. Opposite of radial-out burn.
